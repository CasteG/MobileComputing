## Project Overview: SpaceAttack

**SpaceAttack** is a mobile arcade shooter game developed in Unity, inspired by the classic *X-Out* game for the Commodore 64. This project was created as part of a university assignment to design and develop a mobile application. SpaceAttack features a side-scrolling sci-fi adventure where players navigate battling enemies and obstacles to achieve the highest score.

The game consists of three main scenes:
- **Authentication Screen:** A secure login interface managed by the PlayFab platform.
- **Main Menu:** An intuitive and user-friendly menu for navigating the game's options and settings.
- **Game Scene:** The core gameplay area where players engage in fast-paced shooting action.

The project showcases the application of game development principles, user authentication, and interactive design using Unity.
